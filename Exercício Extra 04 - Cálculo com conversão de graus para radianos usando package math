'''Travel distance of Moon over 12 degrees. Store in dist. 
Calculate the distance travelled by the Moon over 12 degrees of its orbit. Assign the result to dist. 
You can calculate this as r * phi, where r is the radius and phi is the angle in radians. To convert 
an angle in degrees to an angle in radians, use the radians() function, which you just imported.'''

phi = radians(12)
dist = r * phi

# Print out dist
print(dist)
